    "We will be examining the relationship between several variables and their associated insurance premiums. The data set for this challenge is a summary of medical insurance data in the format. This notebook is structured to guide you through the challenge, but feel free to reorganize and add cells where needed in order for you to accomplish the following. In this first section of the notebook you will be exploring the data. \n",
